### B9122 Homework 2
**Author: Shuwen Wang**

This is a repository created for B9122 Homework 2. It contains two python scripts for web-crawling. 'webcrawler.py' is the source code our Professor Kriste created for our reference. 'Pset2.ipynb' is what I created for Homework 2. 
'Pset2.ipynb' implemented web-crawling in two parts:
1. it crawls Fedeveral Reserve's website, and output the urls that has mentioned 'covid'. 
2. it crawls SEC's website and output the urls and texts that mentioned 'charges'.
